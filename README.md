## AI Resume Analyzer & Skill Extractor

This project analyzes resumes (PDFs), extracts key information like skills, education, experience, and projects, classifies the job role, and computes how well it matches a job description using NLP and machine learning techniques. Built with spaCy, scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

## 🧠 Logic Used

### 1. **Resume Parsing & Text Extraction**
- PDF files are parsed using **PyMuPDF (fitz)**.

### 2. **Information Extraction**
- spaCy’s `en_core_web_sm` model helps identify entities and patterns.
- Rule-based matching for extracting:
  - **Skills**
  - **Education** (degree, university)
  - **Experience** (roles, companies)
  - **Projects** (based on keywords like 'developed', 'built', etc.)

### 3. **Job Role Classification**
- A classification model trained on labeled resume text using **TF-IDF** + **scikit-learn classifiers** (e.g., Logistic Regression).

### 4. **Similarity Score Calculation**
- Cosine similarity between job description and resume content using TF-IDF vectors.
- Outputs a percentage match score.

## 📁 Upload Directory

Uploaded resumes are saved in the `uploads/` folder:

```python
UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'uploads'
os.makedirs(UPLOAD_FOLDER, exist_ok=True)
```

When a file is uploaded via the UI:
```python
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload Resume", type=["pdf"])
if uploaded_file:
    with open(os.path.join(UPLOAD_FOLDER, uploaded_file.name), "wb") as f:
        f.write(uploaded_file.getbuffer())
```
